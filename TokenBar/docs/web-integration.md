# OpenAI web integration (Codex)

## What it adds
- Code review remaining (%).
- Usage breakdown (dashboard chart).
- Credits usage history table (when present).

## Opt-in + privacy
- Toggle: Settings → General → “Access OpenAI via web”.
- Reuses existing browser cookies; no credentials stored.
- Web requests go to `chatgpt.com` (same as your browser session).

## Cookie/session model
- Import order: Safari → Chrome (Safari first to avoid Chrome Keychain prompts when Safari matches).
- WebKit uses per-email `WKWebsiteDataStore` so multiple accounts can coexist.
- Email mismatch: if browser email ≠ Codex CLI email, treat as not logged in for that account (cookies retained for later match).

## Troubleshooting
- Safari cookie access may require Full Disk Access; Settings UI links to the system pane.
- Dashboard layout changes can break scraping; errors surface in Settings with a short body sample.
